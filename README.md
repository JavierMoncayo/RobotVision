# RobotVision
Matlab project about image recognition and autonomous robotics.


This project was about computer vision, serial comunication and robotics. 
We developed a little suite to get images via IP (in our case a smartphone), send to an arduino and manage a radio controlled car to follow objects.

You'll see four parts in the software:
  1 -> Only for see the current image.
  2 -> Identify and follow a person.
  3- > Identify and follow a ball (all ball colors!!!!).
  4 -> Identify lines in the envirorment.
  

Unzip the file and execute "RobotVision.fig".

Hope you like it!!!
